# Short Introduction
Hello! My name is Naufaldi and I am very interested in data science and web development. I am an undergraduate student and currently have no working experience. I am very excited to learn more about statistics, data science, and web development.

# Skills
I have worked on a projects using Python for data science, I am looking to learn more languages such as R. For web development, I have worked on javascript, more specifically react, and express. 

# Projects
I have worked on multiple projects througout my time in university. Here are the list of the projects:

## Web projects:
1. [Cloud - native project](https://github.com/MNaufaldi/COMP6573001-2021-Project)
This is a more recent project about creating a cloud-native app. This is my attempt at creating it with following from online resources and online courses.

2. [Microservice project](https://github.com/MNaufaldi/web-project)
This is a project about understanding what microservices are. Therefore, the project require to create a microservice app.

## Data science:
I am currently working on a project that I can't publish yet. But, so far I have written one journal paper with friends about NLP.
